# Cat-API
This repo will contain all of the goodies necessary to run my program which includes a Cat API!! Server-Side Web Programming

## Issues
-Tkinter is really ugly and outdated looking so I might look into switching it up GUI-wise but easy to work with right now
-Just implemented the 'Generate Random Cat IMG' button. Still need to implement the 'Search by breeds' box. -6:04pm 10/9/24
