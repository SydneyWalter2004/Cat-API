# Cat-API
This repo will contain all of the goodies necessary to run my program which includes a Cat API!! Server-Side Web Programming

## Issues
-Issue 1: Originally tried to use Image.ANTIALIAS and it was throwing an error because it's outdated for pillow. Switched it to Image.LANCZOS and that solved it.

## Progession Notes
-Tkinter is really ugly and outdated looking so I might look into switching it up GUI-wise but easy to work with right now
-Just implemented the 'Generate Random Cat IMG' button. Still need to implement the 'Search by breeds' box. -6:04pm 10/9/24
-Just implemented the 'Search image by breed' feature. Went pretty smooth. Functional and contains error handling. -6.15pm 10/9/24
